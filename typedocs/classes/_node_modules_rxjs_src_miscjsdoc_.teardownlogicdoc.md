# Class: TeardownLogicDoc

This interface describes what should be returned by function passed to Observable constructor or static [create](_node_modules_rxjs_src_internal_subscriber_.subscriber.md#create) function. Value of that interface will be used to cancel subscription for given Observable.

`TeardownLogic` can be:

Function
--------

Function that takes no parameters. When consumer of created Observable calls `unsubscribe`, that function will be called

AnonymousSubscription
---------------------

`AnonymousSubscription` is simply an object with `unsubscribe` method on it. That method will work the same as function

void

If created Observable does not have any resources to clean up, function does not have to return anything.
